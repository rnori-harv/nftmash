# Lampoon Round 1 Comp Submission

## Preview of Website
The website is live at: https://www.nftmash.net/. 

## Bugs / Improvements to make

### Logging In (bug)
The website has a slight bug with logging in, as the feed doesn't immediately generate (you have to refresh for it to work), but I'm currently working on patching that. 

### Comment display (bug)
When a user submits a comment, the card still doesn't update immediately (refreshing will reflect the change). This can be changed with the inclusion of some useEffect variables

### UI Changes with Ranking Page (improvement)
Furthermore, the UI improvements for the card (developing a carousel) are currently underway. As per Ishaan and David's comments, I'm using a tinder-like carousel where an individual card is displayed at a time.
